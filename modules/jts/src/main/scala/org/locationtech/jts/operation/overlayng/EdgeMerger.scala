/**
 * Performs merging on the noded edges of the input geometries. Merging takes place on edges which
 * are coincident (i.e. have the same coordinate list, modulo direction). The following situations
 * can occur: <ul> <li>Coincident edges from different input geometries have their labels combined
 * <li>Coincident edges from the same area geometry indicate a topology collapse. In this case the
 * topology locations are "summed" to provide a final assignment of side location <li>Coincident
 * edges from the same linear geometry can simply be merged using the same ON location </ul>
 *
 * The merging attempts to preserve the direction of linear edges if possible (which is the case if
 * there is no other coincident edge, or if all coincident edges have the same direction). This
 * ensures that the overlay output line direction will be as consistent as possible with input
 * lines.
