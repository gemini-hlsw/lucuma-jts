/**
 * Simplifies a buffer input line to remove concavities with shallow depth. <p> The most important
 * benefit of doing this is to reduce the number of points and the complexity of shape which will be
 * buffered. It also reduces the risk of gores created by the quantized fillet arcs (although this
 * issue should be eliminated in any case by the offset curve generation logic). <p> A key aspect of
 * the simplification is that it affects inside (concave or inward) corners only. Convex (outward)
 * corners are preserved, since they are required to ensure that the generated buffer curve lies at
 * the correct distance from the input geometry. <p> Another important heuristic used is that the
 * end segments of the input are never simplified. This ensures that the client buffer code is able
 * to generate end caps faithfully. <p> No attempt is made to avoid self-intersections in the
 * output. This is acceptable for use for generating a buffer offset curve, since the buffer
 * algorithm is insensitive to invalid polygonal geometry. However, this means that this algorithm
 * cannot be used as a general-purpose polygon simplification technique.
