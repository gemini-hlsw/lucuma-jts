/**
 * Counts the number of segments crossed by a horizontal ray extending to the right from a given
 * point, in an incremental fashion. This can be used to determine whether a point lies in a {link
 * Polygonal} geometry. The class determines the situation where the point lies exactly on a
 * segment. When being used for Point-In-Polygon determination, this case allows short-circuiting
 * the evaluation. <p> This class handles polygonal geometries with any number of shells and holes.
 * The orientation of the shell and hole rings is unimportant. In order to compute a correct
 * location for a given polygonal geometry, it is essential that <b>all</b> segments are counted
 * which <ul> <li>touch the ray <li>lie in in any ring which may contain the point </ul> The only
 * exception is when the point-on-segment situation is detected, in which case no further processing
 * is required. The implication of the above rule is that segments which can be a priori determined
 * to <i>not</i> touch the ray (i.e. by a test of their bounding box or Y-extent) do not need to be
 * counted. This allows for optimization by indexing. <p> This implementation uses the
 * extended-precision orientation test, to provide maximum robustness and consistency within other
 * algorithms.
