 * can be forced to be reduced pointwise by using {@link # setPointwise ( boolean )} . Note that in
 * this case the result geometry may be invalid. Linear and point geometry is always reduced
 * pointwise (i.e. without further change to its topology or stucture), since this does not change
 * validity. <p> By default the geometry precision model is not changed. This can be overridden by
 * using {@link # setChangePrecisionModel ( boolean )} . <p> Normally collapsed components (e.g.
 * lines collapsing to a point) are not included in the result. This behavior can be changed by
 * using {@link # setRemoveCollapsedComponents ( boolean )} .
