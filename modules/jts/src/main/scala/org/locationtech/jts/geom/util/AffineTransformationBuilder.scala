/**
 * Builds an {link AffineTransformation} defined by a set of control vectors. A control vector
 * consists of a source point and a destination point, which is the image of the source point under
 * the desired transformation. <p> A transformation is well-defined by a set of three control
 * vectors if and only if the source points are not collinear. (In particular, the degenerate
 * situation where two or more source points are identical will not produce a well-defined
 * transformation). A well-defined transformation exists and is unique. If the control vectors are
 * not well-defined, the system of equations defining the transformation matrix entries is not
 * solvable, and no transformation can be determined. <p> No such restriction applies to the
 * destination points. However, if the destination points are collinear or non-unique, a
 * non-invertible transformations will be generated. <p> This technique of recovering a
 * transformation from its effect on known points is used in the Bilinear Interpolated Triangulation
 * algorithm for warping planar surfaces.
