/**
 * The internal representation of a list of coordinates inside a Geometry. <p> This allows
 * Geometries to store their points using something other than the JTS {link Coordinate} class. For
 * example, a storage-efficient implementation might store coordinate sequences as an array of x's
 * and an array of y's. Or a custom coordinate class might support extra attributes like M-values.
 * <p> Implementing a custom coordinate storage structure requires implementing the {link
 * CoordinateSequence} and {link CoordinateSequenceFactory} interfaces. To use the custom
 * CoordinateSequence, create a new {link GeometryFactory} parameterized by the
 * CoordinateSequenceFactory The {link GeometryFactory} can then be used to create new {link
 * Geometry}s. The new Geometries will use the custom CoordinateSequence implementation. <p> For an
 * example, see the code for {link ExtendedCoordinateExample}.
