/**
 * Limits the segments in a list of segments to those which intersect an envelope. This creates zero
 * or more sections of the input segment sequences, containing only line segments which intersect
 * the limit envelope. Segments are not clipped, since that can move line segments enough to alter
 * topology, and it happens in the overlay in any case. This can substantially reduce the number of
 * vertices which need to be processed during overlay. <p> This optimization is only applicable to
 * Line geometries, since it does not maintain the closed topology of rings. Polygonal geometries
 * are optimized using the {@link RingClipper} .
